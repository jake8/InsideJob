Inside Job was written in early October 2010 by [Adam Preble](http://adampreble.net).

Features include:

- Native Cocoa interface.
- Drag and drop inventory editing with item images.
- Item list searchable by name or item number.
- Experimental "time of day" editing.

### System Requirements

Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard.

### Instructions

Inside Job operates on Minecraft's level.dat files, located in _~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/saves/.  While Inside Job was written to interact with Minecraft's data as safely as possible, it's entirely possible that it will destroy it completely.  Please back up your Minecraft saves folder before using Inside Job.

Be sure to save and exit any open Minecraft worlds before running Inside Job.  Once run, Inside Job will open the first world and display your inventory. Note that Inside Job can only edit existing worlds.

To alter your inventory, use the item list at right to find the item you desire, then drag it into an  inventory slot.  Rearrange items by dragging them to different slots.  To copy an item, including its quantity, hold the Option key when you start dragging.

Note that Inside Job works differently from the Minecraft inventory screen in that it does not "swap" items when dropping an item onto another.  Instead, it replaces the item completely.  If you drag an item into a slot already containing that item, the quantity will be increased accordingly, up to 64.

To alter the quantity or damage of a particular item, click on its inventory slot.  To accept the changes, hit escape or click outside of the popup window.

After changing your inventory you will need to save the currently open world using the World menu, or Command-S.  Once you have saved the world you can open it in Minecraft.  Note that if a world is opened in Minecraft while it is open in Inside Job, you will need to reload it using the World menu, or Command-R.  This is because Minecraft's file locking system gives write access to the last program to open it.
